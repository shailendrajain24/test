<div>
    Utility to help you learn the Groovy code which can be used to define various steps.
    Pick a step you are interested in from the list, configure it, click <b>Generate Groovy</b>,
    and you will see a Groovy statement that would call the step with that configuration.
    You may copy and paste the whole statement into your script, or pick up just the options you care about.
    (Most parameters are optional and can be omitted in your script, leaving them at default values.)
